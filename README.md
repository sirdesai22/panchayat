## The problem

India's real supply lives on the other end of a phone call. The shop in Koramangala that has the phone you want in stock, the injection moulding unit that can quote your part, the packers who can move your house next Saturday — none of them are on a website with a price on it. Finding the right rate means an hour of calls, in the right language, with the confidence to ask twice. Most people simply pay the first number they hear.

## What it does

PanchayatAI does that hour of calls in ninety seconds. You describe what you want, the target price, and the city. It finds counterparties, dials six of them at once over real PSTN telephony, speaks to each one in their own language, extracts the facts that actually matter for that market, pushes for a better rate, and returns a single comparison board with verified quotes and the money saved.

Like a panchayat, the agents do not work alone: they confer with each other while every line is still open, so a rate quoted on one call becomes leverage on another before either shopkeeper has hung up.

## Built end to end on Sarvam AI

- **Sarvam realtime speech to text** over a streaming socket, with automatic language detection on every turn, so a caller who switches from Kannada to English mid-sentence is followed without a hitch
- **`sarvam-105b-conversations` as the reasoning core**, driving a state machine that opens, anchors, concedes in planned steps, and holds a reservation price it will not cross
- **Bulbul v3 text to speech**, synthesised natively at 8 kHz mulaw to match the telephony wire format, so audio moves from the shopkeeper's phone into Sarvam and back with no transcoding in the path

## Key features

**1. Parallel calls that share what they learn.** A live Fact Bus publishes every fact the instant it is spoken, so six conversations behave like one informed buyer instead of six separate ones. Every leverage line is grounded in a rate that genuinely arrived on the bus, verified in code before it can ever be said out loud.

**2. Every language of the market.** Language is detected per turn and the reply is voiced by a matched Bulbul speaker across Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Indian English, with the persona and honorifics that fit the trade.

**3. Human-paced conversation.** Echo-gated barge-in lets the shopkeeper interrupt and be heard immediately, and speech is synthesised sentence by sentence as the reply is still being written, so replies land in the rhythm of a real phone call rather than after a pause.

**4. New markets without new code.** Electronics retail, factory RFQs, freelance hiring and movers each ship as a single declarative skill file describing the fields to extract, what can move on price, the tactics, the voice, and how savings are computed. A new market is a file and a hot reload, not a release.

## For developers

### Run it

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env    # fill in SARVAM_API_KEY at minimum
```

The `.env` lives at the **workspace root**, not inside `apps/*` - both apps are wired to read it from there.

Apply the database schema once, or nothing persists and the counters stay at zero:
paste `apps/orchestrator/sql/schema.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor.

Two processes:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

The orchestrator prints exactly which integrations are live at boot, so a missing key is obvious before the demo rather than during it.

### No keys yet?

```bash
MOCK_SARVAM=1 pnpm dev:api
```

Mock mode swaps in a deterministic stand-in for STT, TTS, and the negotiation brain.
The whole board runs - state machine, fact bus, leverage, savings math, live theater - without a single API call.
This is for building the UI and for CI, never a runtime fallback: if the key is missing in production the engine says so loudly instead of quietly faking a negotiation.

### Real phone calls

```bash
pnpm twilio:check
```

Run that before every rehearsal. It catches the failures that are invisible until you dial: geo permissions blocking India, a placeholder tunnel URL, a trial account, a number without voice capability.

**You do not configure anything on the number itself.** The Voice URL and Messaging URL in the console govern *inbound* calls. MolBhav dials outbound and passes its TwiML inline on `calls.create()`, so there is no webhook to point anywhere and no TwiML App to create. A number fresh out of the box, still pointing at `demo.twilio.com`, works.

What you actually need:

1. **Account SID and Auth Token** - console home page, Account Info panel. SID starts with `AC`.
2. **The number in E.164** - `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+15188643842`, no spaces or dashes.
3. **A public HTTPS tunnel**, because Twilio has to open a media stream *back* to your laptop:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```
   Put the https URL in `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. The stream lands on `wss://<host>/media/:callId`.
4. **Geo permissions for India** - Voice → Settings → Geo Permissions. Off by default for most accounts; calls fail with error 21215 until it is ticked.

**Trial accounts cannot do this demo.** Two blockers, both fatal on stage: you can only dial numbers you have verified in the console, and Twilio plays its own "you have a trial account" announcement to whoever answers - over your opener, before the counterparty has heard a word from you. Upgrade, or run the demo against verified teammate numbers.

### Test mode

Real telephony, real Sarvam, real barge-in - but every call rings *your* phone instead of a shop. You answer and play the shopkeeper while the board shows "Sangeetha Mobiles Koramangala" negotiating in Kannada.

```
TEST_CALL_REDIRECT=+917411420401
```

Toggle it in the composer, or per request:

```jsonc
{ "skill_id": "electronics", "spec": { ... }, "test": true }
// optionally override the number for this run:
{ "test": true, "test_number": "+919876543210" }
```

What changes when it is on, and nothing else does:

- every call dials the redirect number, keeping its counterparty's name, language, and persona
- **only one counterparty is rung** (`TEST_CALL_COUNT`, or `test_calls` per request). You are rehearsing one conversation, not answering the same call five times. Raise it to 2 when you want to rehearse the cross-call leverage beat, which needs a second quote on the bus before it can fire
- calls run **one at a time** - one human cannot answer six phones
- the calling-window guard is skipped, since no shop is being disturbed
- the mission is tagged `test` and is excluded from the savings counter, the call count, and the Bhav Index
- the board carries a `TEST RUN` banner naming the number being rung

That last pair matters more than it looks. A rehearsal that quietly inflates the number on the wall is a number you cannot show a judge.

This is also the **only way to place a real PSTN call on a trial account**, since trial can only dial numbers you have verified - and your own number already is.

**A +1 caller ID is a pickup-rate problem.** Nothing in this codebase can fix what the shopkeeper sees on their screen: an unknown US number. Expect a lot of unanswered calls. Twilio cannot originate calls *within* India for regulatory reasons, which is why the spec's Exotel side-quest exists.

## What is verified, and what is not

Checked against the official SDK (`sarvamai@1.1.8`), not from documentation:

| Question | Answer | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Does TTS emit 8 kHz? | Yes, `speech_sample_rate: 8000` | No downsampling |
| Can STT take Twilio's wire format? | Yes - `speechToTextRealtimeStreaming` accepts `encoding: "mulaw"`, `sample_rate: "8000"` | **No transcode layer anywhere.** Twilio frames go straight into Sarvam and Bulbul's mulaw comes straight back out |
| Server-side turn detection? | Yes - `endpointing: "vad"`, plus `silence_duration_ms`, `threshold`, `prefix_padding_ms` | Nothing in this codebase counts silence |
| Language detection? | `language_code: "auto"` returns `language` on every final transcript | Voice selection is free |
| Which speakers exist? | `bulbul:v2` has **7**; `bulbul:v3` has **37** | See below |
| Which chat models exist? | `sarvam-m` is **deprecated (400)**. `sarvam-105b` is a reasoning model that spends its whole budget thinking and returns `content: null` at phone-call token caps. Only **`sarvam-105b-conversations`** is usable | Both `NEGOTIATE_MODEL` and `FAST_MODEL` point at it |
| Guaranteed JSON? | **No.** `json_schema` mode is degenerate - the model emits a valid object then floods whitespace to the token cap, ~13s, invalid. `json_object` works, ~2s | The contract is `json_object` plus a literal shape in the prompt, with retry and salvage behind it |

**The Node 22 trap.** `sarvamai@1.1.8` selects its WebSocket with `typeof WebSocket !== "undefined" ? WebSocket : require("ws")`. Node 22 ships a global `WebSocket` that ignores the options argument, so the `api-subscription-key` header the SDK assembles is silently dropped and the realtime STT socket answers *"Invalid subscription key"* - with a key that works perfectly over REST. On Node 18 or 20 the same code falls through to `ws` and works, which makes this look like an account problem rather than a runtime one.

`sarvam/stt.ts` therefore opens that socket with `ws` directly. Verified against the live endpoint: the header is accepted and the query parameter is rejected, so the header is the only way in.

**The tunnel trap.** Twilio is an anonymous client. A VS Code dev tunnel is private by default, so it works in your browser (which carries a session cookie) and returns 401 to Twilio - and refuses the websocket upgrade, which Twilio reports only as `error 31920`. `pnpm twilio:check` now probes both the HTTP endpoint and a real websocket upgrade anonymously.

**The speaker trap.** The original spec's skill files named `kavitha`, `pooja`, `amit`, `gokul`, and `shreya` on `bulbul:v2`. Those voices do not exist on v2 - they are v3-only, and the failure surfaces at synthesis time, which is to say live, mid-call. Every pack now runs on `bulbul:v3`, and the loader rejects any pack whose speaker is not on its model's roster.

Still unverified (needs the venue network and a real key): rate limits and concurrency on hackathon credits, and measured `sarvam-105b` turn latency against the budget.

## Adding a market

1. Write `packages/skills/<id>.skill.json`
2. Add a seed CSV of real, publicly listed numbers
3. `pnpm skills:check` - the loader validates cross-field consistency, not just shape
4. `pnpm eval --skill <id>` - gate is 7/10 personas
5. `POST /admin/skills/reload` - the market is live

If any of that required editing `apps/orchestrator/src/engine/`, the abstraction is wrong. Fix the skill, not the engine.

```bash
pnpm skills:check
```

```bash
MOCK_SARVAM=1 pnpm eval --seeds 2 --mock
```

## How it fits together

```
Next.js theater  ──SSE──►  Orchestrator  ──►  Twilio Media Streams  ──►  PSTN
  (schema-driven)              │                  mulaw 8k both ways
                               ├── SkillPack registry (hot-reloadable)
                               ├── Fact Bus ─── leverage · dedup · dead-lead
                               ├── Negotiation core (transport-agnostic)
                               └── Sarvam: realtime STT → chat → Bulbul
                                          │
                                     Supabase (missions, calls, index)
```

**The seam that matters** is `engine/transport.ts`. A PSTN call and a simulated counterparty implement the same three verbs, so the eval harness exercises the exact code that runs on stage - and when venue telephony wobbles, the demo falls back to the simulator without the engine noticing.

**The Fact Bus** is why six parallel calls beat six sequential ones. Facts publish the instant they are learned, so a quote from line 3 is leverage on line 1 while both are still open. Leverage lines may only ever quote numbers that actually arrived on the bus - enforced in `fact-bus.ts`, restated in the prompt, and checked by the eval harness.

### Deliberate departures from the spec

- **SSE instead of Supabase Realtime for the theater.** The events originate in the orchestrator; routing them through the database and back adds a hop, a schema, and a failure mode on the one surface judges actually watch. Supabase still stores everything for counters and the index.
- **`bulbul:v3` over `v2`.** v3 has the voices the skill files need plus `dict_id` for SKU pronunciation. It loses Sarvam's beta response cache, so fillers are cached in-process instead - which is faster anyway.
- **Retry-and-salvage instead of trusting structured outputs.** About one turn in five comes back malformed - either whitespace-flooded to the cap, or with the sentence present but the key missing (`{ "Yeh price abhi valid hai." }`). `sarvam/chat.ts` retries once at low temperature, then repairs truncated objects, then reads a keyless reply as the primary field. Measured over a four-line mission: 7 retries, 4 salvages, **0 hard failures**. Going silent on a live phone call is not an acceptable way to handle a malformed token stream.

## Before dialling anyone

Seed CSVs ship with deliberately invalid `+9190000000xx` numbers so an accidental run cannot reach a stranger. Replace them with numbers that are publicly listed for business contact.

The engine refuses to dial outside 09:00-20:30 IST (`IGNORE_CALL_WINDOW=1` for rehearsal), checks an opt-out list before every call, and answers honestly the moment anyone asks whether they are talking to a machine. Those rules live in the engine, not in a skill file, because no market gets to opt out of them.
